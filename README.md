REAL-TIME FACE DETECTION USING OPENCV

First of all make sure you have OpenCV installed. 
You can install it using pip:

•	Pip install openCV-python

•	Haar Cascade algorithm is basically a machine learning object detection algorithm which is used to identify objects in an image or video. Face detection using Haar cascades is an approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pretrained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.

•	In OpenCV, we have several trained Haar Cascade models which are saved as XML files. Instead of creating and training the model from scratch, we use this file. We are going to use “haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml” file in this project.
